# Serial Framing Protocol Library

`libsfp` implements a reliable, message-oriented, point-to-point communications protocol suitable
for embedding in systems with severely constrained resources. It was originally designed to run on
an 8-bit AVR microcontroller with 16K RAM. It has one dependency:
[`cxx-util`](https://github.com/BaroboRobotics/cxx-util).

There is currently no real documentation, but you can ping
[@harrishancock](https://github.com/harrishancock) if you have questions.
