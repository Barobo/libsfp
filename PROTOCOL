== Connection Phase ==

In a connect state other than CONNECTED, user frames are not allowed to be
transmitted. 

In the connection phase, both hosts are in undefined states. sfpConnect() is
called on one of the hosts, which performs the following actions:

1. Clears its history.
2. Sends an unrecorded SYN0 frame.
3. Sets its connect state to SENT_SYN0.

Upon receipt of a SYN0, a host performs the following actions:

1. Clears its history.
2. Sends an unrecorded SYN1 frame.
3. Sets its connect state to SENT_SYN1.

Upon receipt of a SYN1, a host performs the following actions:

1. Sends an unrecorded SYN2 frame.
2. Sets its connect state to CONNECTED.
3. Sends its history.

Upon receipt of a SYN2, a host performs the following actions:

1. Sets its connect state to CONNECTED.
2. Sends its history.

Note that in the latter two actions (receipt of SYN1 and SYN2), the history is
sent. This is because 

If sfpConnect() is called on both hosts simultaneously, this will lead to an
infinite loop: each host will be stuck in a disconnected state, re-sending
their SYN0 frames each time they receive a SYN0. In the future, SYN frames may
hold a random challenge number, and the lower one wins. For now, simply choose
one host and only one host to call sfpConnect() on.
